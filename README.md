The purpose for this project is to duplicate the core structure of IntegraMOD 151, to build a solid bootstrap template

It is not recomended to run this in a live environment because it is a work in progress. The subSilver template works fine but fisubSilver is still under construction and it has not been fully debugged beyond php7.0
